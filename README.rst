MicroTardis: Customisation of MyTardis for RMIT Microscopy and Microanalysis Facility.
======================================================================================

MyTARDIS is a multi-institutional collaborative venture that
facilitates the archiving and sharing of data and metadata collected
at major facilities such as the Australian Synchrotron and ANSTO and
within Institutions.

MicroTardis is an extension of the MyTARDIS system for the task 
of transferring data and metadata from remote microscopy facilities, 
automatic extraction of microscopy image or spectra metadata, and
curation of experiments for researcher access.
